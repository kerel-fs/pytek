**PyTek** provides a python API for interacting with Tektronix oscilloscopes over a serial
interface. It currently supports some basic commands for the TDS3000
series of Digital Phosphor Oscilloscopes, especially *capturing waveforms*
and *screen shots* from the device.

.. note:: **Serial Port not Included**

    PyTek relies on a thirdparty serial port for communications, specifically
    one that matches the `pyserial`_ API. It is recommended that you simply use
    `pyserial`_ itself.

tl;dr
---------------

What?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A python package that gives you an API for interacting with supported Tektronix
oscilloscopes over a serial interace.

Install?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install pytek

Or, from source:

.. code:: bash

    $ python setup.py install


Serial?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We don't provide a serial port implementation. We suggest, `pyserial`_:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install pyserial

Examples?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    >>> from serial import Serial
    >>> from pytek import TDS3k
    >>> 
    >>> port = Serial("COM1", 9600, timeout=1)
    >>> tds = TDS3k(port)
    >>> 
    >>> 
    >>> # Make the scope identify itself.
    ...
    >>> tds.identify()
    'TEKTRONIX,TDS 3034,0,CF:91.1CT FV:v2.11 TDS3GM:v1.00 TDS3FFT:v1.00 TDS3TRG:v1.00'
    >>> 
    >>> 
    >>> 
    >>> # Capture waveform data
    ...
    >>> waveform = tds.get_waveform(start=100, stop=109)
    >>> waveform
    <generator object <genexpr> at 0x0238B8A0>
    >> 
    >>> for x,y in waveform:
    ...     print x, y
    ...

    -0.004491 -0.08
    >>> 
    >>> tds.x_units()
    's'
    >>> tds.y_units()
    'V'
    >>> 
    >>> 
    >>> 
    >>> # Grab a screen shot (this will take a few minutes).
    ...
    >>> ofile = open("screenshot.tiff", "wb")
    >>> tds.screenshot(ofile, "tiff")
    >>> 
    >>> 
    >>> 
    >>> 
    >>> #Fin.
    ...
    >>> tds.close()
    >>> 

Dependencies?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll need a serial port interface. See the "`Serial?`_" section, above.

To build the sphinx docs from source (as is), you'll need the `sphinx_rtd_theme`_:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install sphinx_rtd_theme


Extras?
~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyTek package includes the following extras (optional installs):

serial
    Adds `pyserial`_ package as a requirement, the recommended serial port interface.

docs
    Adds `sphinx_rtd_theme`_ package as a requirement, needed for building sphinx docs.


Docs?
~~~~~~~~

* `Read The Docs (.org) <http://pytek.readthedocs.org/>`_
* `Python Hosted (.org) <http://pythonhosted.org/pytek/>`_
